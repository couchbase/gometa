# CMAKE_MODULE_PATH - should contain a directory containing
#      FindCouchbaseGo.cmake, eg. tlm/cmake/Modules
#
# CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX - should point to a directory where the bin/ output
#      directory will be placed
#
# GODEPSPATH - should point to a Go workspace directory containing all
#      transitive Go dependencies
#
# FORESTDB_INCLUDE_DIR - should point to where libforestdb/forestdb.h exists
#
# FORESTDB_LIBRARY_DIR - should point to where libforestdb.so resides
#
# Optionally:
#
# FORESTDB_TARGET - if set, assumed to the the CMake target name which
# builds libforestdb.so; will set dependencies to ensure it is build
# before attempting to compile indexer
